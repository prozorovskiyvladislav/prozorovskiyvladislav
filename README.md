# Hi, I'm Vladyslav Prozorovskiy! 👋

I am a Front-End Engineer with 7 years of experience, primarily working with the React framework. Over the years, I have contributed to 10+ projects, utilizing Redux for state management and Next.js for server-side rendering. Now, I am expanding my expertise to Full-Stack Development, diving into Python, Django, and Django REST Framework to build robust web applications.

Beyond coding, I am also passionate about web security and hold a Google certification in the field. Currently, I'm exploring Docker, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes to enhance CI/CD workflows and streamline project deployments.
